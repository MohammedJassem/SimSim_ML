# Machine Learning Project Repository

## Overview

Welcome to our machine learning project repository! This repository is designed to be a flexible framework for training and deploying various machine learning models. Currently, it includes implementations for segmentation and named entity recognition (NER) models.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Install Dependencies

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Preparation

Prepare your data for segmentation and NER. For NER, use the following example training script:

bash

python3 train.py --file_path /downloads/ner_datasetreference.csv --epochs 5 --train_batch_size 8 --valid_batch_size 4 --learning_rate 0.0001 --max_grad_norm 5

Segmentation Model

Implement and train your segmentation model in the segmentation directory.

FastAPI API

To run the FastAPI API for inference:

bash

uvicorn main:app --reload

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser to explore the API documentation and test the models.
